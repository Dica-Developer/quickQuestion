  "readme": "# root\n\na super lightweight web framework with routing and connect and [protein](https://github.com/mafintosh/protein) middleware support.\nit's available through npm:\n\n\tnpm install root\n\nusage is simple\n\n``` js\nvar root = require('root');\nvar app = root();\n\napp.get('/', function(request, response) {\n\tresponse.end('i am root');\n});\n\napp.listen(8080);\n```\n\nall routing is supported by the [router](https://github.com/gett/router) module.\n\n## Middleware\n\nto apply middleware simply use `use`\n\n``` js\napp.use(function(request, response, next) { // or pass any connect-based middleware\n\trequest.foo = 'bar!';\n\tnext();\n});\n\napp.get(function(request, response) {\n\tresponse.end('foo: '+request.foo);\n});\n```\n\nif you don't want to run a specific middleware on every request you can put it in a branch\n\n``` js\nvar app = root('auth');\n\napp.use(root.query);\napp.auth.use(function(request, response, next) {\n\tif (!request.query.auth) {\n\t\tresponse.writeHead(403);\n\t\tresponse.end();\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\tnext();\n});\n\napp.get('/', function(request, response) {\n\tresponse.end('hello - all other calls are authenticated...');\n});\n\napp.auth.get(function(request, response) {\n\tresponse.end('hello mr auth');\n});\n\n// now visit /, /test and /test?auth=1\n```\n\nyou can see the [root.json](https://github.com/mafintosh/root/blob/master/middleware/json.js) and [root.query](https://github.com/mafintosh/root/blob/master/middleware/query.js) middleware for examples on how to write your own.\n\n## Prototypical middleware\n\nroot allows you to specify a prototype for the request and response to create useful and ultra fast middleware methods.\nit does this by using the [protein](https://github.com/mafintosh/protein) module\n\n``` js\nvar myMiddleware = function(request, respone, next) { // we could also just use an empty object literal\n\trequest.pong = Date.now();\n\tnext();\n};\n```\n\nWe can choose to expand the request and response with additional methods\n\n``` js\nmyMiddleware.response = {};\nmyMiddleware.response.ping = function() { // let's expand the response with a new method\n\tthis.end(this.request.pong);\n};\n\nmyMiddleware.request = {};\nmyMiddleware.request.__defineGetter__('host', function() { // we can even use getters!\n\treturn this.headers.host;\n});\n```\n\nNow if we pass this middleware to `app.use` we'll be able to use methods in our request handlers:\n\n``` js\napp.use(myMiddleware);\napp.get(function(request, response) {\n\tconsole.log('host: '+request.host);\n\tresponse.ping();\n});\n```\n\nThere is also a shorthand syntax for doing this through the methods `fn` and `getter`:\n\n``` js\napp.fn('response.ping', function() {\n\treturn this.request.pong;\n});\napp.getter('request.host', function() {\n\treturn this.headers.host;\n});\n```\n\n\n## License \n\n**This software is licensed under \"MIT\"**\n\n> Copyright (c) 2012 Mathias Buus Madsen <mathiasbuus@gmail.com>\n> \n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n> \n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n> \n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
